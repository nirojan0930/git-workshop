Hey, this is my first homepage, so now i would like to tell something about myself. its hard to start yourself because you know more about yourself. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.

I am a simple person as like you but every person have something different I'm also.
 There are lot of things I would like to do, to see, to hear, to touch, to smell, to speak and to experience. 
 I like to play, study, read, write, think and so on.
